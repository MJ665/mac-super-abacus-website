## Stats For My Uni

**Open Source Organization**  
**November 2023 - Current**  
[Website](https://statsformyuni.com/) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Stats-For-My-Uni/statsForMyUni)

In November 2023, I undertook a project for a relative to create a website for a small but impactful initiative, **Stats For My Uni**. This platform allows students to showcase their profiles and essays crafted for university applications abroad. 

### Key Contributions:
- **Development**: Designed and implemented the website using a robust stack including JavaScript, Node.js, Webpack, React, and Firebase. The site is hosted with a GoDaddy domain and integrated with GitHub for version control.
- **Functionality**: Developed features enabling students to receive feedback on their profiles and essays, aimed at enhancing the utility of their submissions for others.
- **SEO Optimization**: Enhanced the website's visibility through targeted SEO strategies, improving its accessibility and reach.

This project reflects my commitment to leveraging technology to support students in their academic endeavors and demonstrates my skills in full-stack web development and SEO practices.
