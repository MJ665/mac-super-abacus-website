## Super Abacus: Enhancing Online Presence

**Super Abacus** is a small-scale abacus training center dedicated to providing quality abacus education. To expand their reach and improve accessibility, they have recently embarked on a project to increase their online presence.

I was entrusted with the task of developing a new website for Super Abacus. This website will serve as a crucial platform for reaching a broader audience and showcasing their abacus classes. It will feature comprehensive information about their offerings, class schedules, and enrollment options.

The website will be going live soon, and in the spirit of open-source collaboration, the full-stack code will be made publicly available. This initiative aligns with our commitment to transparency and community engagement, allowing others to learn from and contribute to the project.

Stay tuned for the launch of the Super Abacus website and explore how this project is set to revolutionize abacus education online!
